# py-sweeper

> Minesweeper made in python! (with pygame)

This is my "personal python project" for the course SC-T-201-GSKI. It is a fully-featured clone of the popular application minesweeper featured in early versions of Microsoft Windows

Keep your addictive minesweeping personality satisfied on newer windows versions with py-sweeper!

With three difficulty settings to choose from and millions of random configurations, you're sure to never get bored!

## Installation

This project requires both python 3.6+ and pygame. You can install pygame it with:<br>
`pip install pygame`

Run `main.py` in the project directory!
